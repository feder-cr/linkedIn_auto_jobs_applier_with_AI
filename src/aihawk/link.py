"""One long-lived MCP connection, shared by the conversation and the live view.

The connection outlives any single instruction, because the browser has to still
be there when the next line is typed and the live pane has to keep watching it
in between. One way in is the whole point of the page this serves.

WHY THIS IS A CLIENT AND NOT AN IMPORT. The same shell used to run inside the MCP
server process and reach the browser through `registry`, which is a Python object
in the same interpreter. Here it is a separate program talking over MCP, and that
is the point of the split rather than an accident of it: the server exposes tools
and nothing else, and everything with a face is a client of those tools, exactly
like anybody else's agent.

⛔ THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO DESCRIBE A COST THAT NO LONGER EXISTS, and left saying
so would be exactly the kind of stale reasoning this project keeps finding one
step past where it was written. The in-process view could once ask
`registry.peek` - "is there a browser, without starting one" - and there was no
such question over MCP at all: the tab tool of the day called `ensure`
regardless, so asking would start a browser just to be told nothing was
running. `Link` used to
work around that by remembering whether it had EVER issued an instruction, and
the live view stayed quiet until it had - a coarser answer than the real
question, armed by the first call of any kind rather than by whether a browser
was actually up.

The real question exists now: `browser_watch` refuses rather than starts when
nothing is running, and `browser_list` answers what is held without waking any
of it (`registry.peek` reached from `looking`, in `mcp/server.py`), so a client
can simply ask and read the answer.
`Link` remembers nothing any more; there is nothing left it needs to.

# gave every call this conversation's id, imposed rather than trusted from a
# model, because one shared connection served every conversation and a tool
# call naming none landed on a default that two conversations could collide
# on. MCP has no session concept to impose an id ONTO any more - no tool
# takes one - so the only way left to keep two conversations apart is the one
# this always should have been: two conversations, two CONNECTIONS, each its
# own spawned server told at birth which saved file is its own
# (`AIHAWK_SESSION_ID`, in `Sessions.get`). A plain `Link` is what every
# conversation holds now; there is no second class to wrap it in.
