    every call, because MCP itself understood "session" as a tool argument. It
    does not any more: no tool takes one, none can be listed, none can be
    reached from another. So the id can no longer be a value passed over an
    open connection - it has to be which CONNECTION exists at all, and that
    means one conversation, one spawned server PROCESS, its `AIHAWK_SESSION_ID`
    set at the moment it is started. Two ids would have been easier only in the

    Conversations are built ON DEMAND and read from disk the first time they are

        does not find is right for a caller that MEANS to start a conversation -
        `new`, an embedder, a test - and wrong for a request that only means to
        look at one. Measured: a page left open on a session somebody deleted
        went on asking `/live/browsers` every three seconds, and one of those
        questions was enough to declare the session again. The delete worked,
        answered `forgotten:true`, closed the browsers, erased the file - and the
        row came back on its own, empty and unnamed, for as long as that tab
        stayed open. Every visible signal said the delete had failed.

        ⛔ AND IT ASKS ABOUT BOTH HALVES OF A SESSION, because a session is a
        conversation AND its browsers and either half can be the only one on

        touches this interface writes the browsers and no transcript; opening
        `?s=work` here has to work, and asking only about transcripts would have
        refused it. That is the same defect this method exists to fix, made one
        step further along - which is why it is written into the one question
        rather than into the routes that ask it.

        Each half is asked of whoever owns it: what is in memory of this
        registry, what is on disk of the store. On disk means the FILE is
        there, not that it parses: `get` reads it once, right after, and
        reading it here as well was the same file parsed twice per request. The default is always known
        because it is the conversation a page with no id gets, and on a fresh

        HAPPENS CHANGED WITH EVERYTHING ELSE ON 2026-09-11. There used to be a
        tool, `session_forget`, that closed the browsers of a session named on
        an open connection shared with every other conversation. There is no
        such tool now, and there could not be one that stayed inside the rule
        the owner set: MCP cannot be asked to operate on a piece of work that
        is not its own. So this reaches for the ONLY thing that was ever
        really being asked for - closing that conversation's OWN connection,
        which is that conversation's OWN server process, and closing that ends
        it exactly the way a standalone client disconnecting always has: the
        stdio EOF this sends is what `_lifespan` in `mcp/server.py` already
        closes every browser on, the same path every such client relies on,
        not a new one built for this.

        The saved browser file is erased directly, by calling into `store` in
        this same package - not over MCP, because MCP has no tool that reaches
        a piece of work other than its own, and this IS the process whose own
        file it is (or was, if it was never brought up this run). That call is
        a plain function, not a wire protocol: it costs nothing to make and
        asks nothing of anybody.

        Refused while that conversation is mid-run: the same reason `reset` is.

        ⛔ AND `False` MEANS THAT AND NOTHING ELSE. It used to mean "there was
        nothing to erase" as well, and the two are opposite news: the page reads
        it and says "that session is still working, so it was not deleted", which
        for a session somebody else had already deleted is the wrong sentence in
        both halves. The caller asked for it to be gone; if it is gone, the
