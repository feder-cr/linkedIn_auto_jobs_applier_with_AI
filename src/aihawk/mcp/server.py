"""MCP server exposing two stealth browsers, `main` and `support`.

⛔ THERE IS NO SESSION CONCEPT HERE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE - not an omission,
and not the same claim this file made a day earlier when a session held up to
eight named browsers. This process serves exactly ONE piece of work: the two
fixed browsers above, and nothing a tool can enumerate, name or reach a SECOND
one of. `AIHAWK_SESSION_ID`, read once from the environment near the top of
this file, decides which saved file that one piece of work persists to - set
by whoever spawns this process, never by a tool argument, never published in
a schema, never something a model can read or pass. A model working through
this server cannot ask "what else is there" because there is no "else" to ask
about.

Tool names mirror the Microsoft Playwright MCP so prompts stay portable, with
one deliberate departure: there are no tab tools. A browser here drives ONE
page. Playwright's MCP offers `browser_tab_*` and this server briefly did too;
they were removed because the case they serve is better served by `support` -
a second tab carries the identity's cookies and fingerprint to the second
site, which is the one thing the two browsers exist to keep apart.

Config comes from STEALTHFOX_* env vars. A command starts a browser when none
is running; a read does not. `work.py` is where that rule lives.

Every tool here is a wrapper. The operations live in `actions.py` and the
browsers live in `registry.py`, so every client drives them through exactly
the same code rather than through a second implementation that would drift
from this one.

Transport is stdio by default, which is what existing clients expect. Set
STEALTHFOX_MCP_TRANSPORT=http to serve over streamable HTTP instead, which is
what lets more than one client attach to the same live browser.

THERE IS NO INTERFACE HERE, and that is the point rather than an omission. This
package served a two-pane page and a live view until 0.9.0, reaching the browser
through `registry` because it was in the same process. Both moved to `aihawk`,
which now reaches the browser over MCP like anybody else. What that buys is not
tidiness: it means no client has a privileged path, so the tools below are
provably sufficient for the flagship interface, because the flagship interface
is a client of them. A page kept inside the server is a page whose needs quietly
become the server's requirements.

# The ladder, stated once. Each tool's own description says what that tool does;

# went from "click the select" straight to running `s.value='beta'` as script,
# skipping the two rungs in between - coordinates, and a screenshot - because
# nothing had told it they were rungs.
INSTRUCTIONS = """Two browsers, `main` and `support`, are already there. There is
nothing to list or choose before acting: go straight to the task with
browser_navigate on `main`, which opens it if it is not open yet.

A LOOK DOES NOT OPEN A BROWSER. Every reading tool below needs one that is
already running and says so plainly if none is. Send a command first -
browser_navigate, or browser_open if you want to choose the identity, the exit
or the profile - and then look.

Drive the page the way a person would. Everything here goes
through the real pointer and the real keyboard.

Try things in this order. It matters, because a page can tell the difference.

1. A named tool with a selector: browser_click, browser_type,
   browser_select_option, browser_press_key. browser_snapshot gives you the
   selector for each element - pass it verbatim, it is built to be unambiguous.

2. Coordinates. browser_snapshot reports `at: [x, y]` for every element it
   lists, in viewport pixels. browser_click_at takes exactly those and moves the
   pointer there. This is the rung for anything a selector does not describe: a
   canvas, a slider, a map, a custom widget built out of divs.

3. Your eyes. browser_take_screenshot, find the thing in the picture, then
   browser_click_at on where it is. For what the snapshot does not list at all.

4. browser_evaluate, to READ what none of the above can see.

browser_evaluate refuses the obvious ways to act on the page, and names the tool
to use instead: assigning to value, checked or selected, or calling click(),
dispatchEvent(), submit() or requestSubmit(). All of those skip the keyboard and
the pointer, so the event arrives with isTrusted false - the single clearest
signal that something other than a person is driving, and avoiding it is what
this browser is for. When you want that, rung 2 or rung 3 is what you actually
want.

That refusal is a guardrail on the obvious road, not a wall around the field.
JavaScript has unlimited ways to say the same thing and this catches the ones
worth catching, so DO NOT read a silent pass as permission: if you find a way to
change the page through browser_evaluate, that is the bug, and saying so in your
answer is worth more than using it.

You do not need script to read state back, either. The snapshot carries
`checked` for a checkbox or radio and `value` for a select, alongside the text.

If you get to the bottom of the ladder and still cannot do the thing, say so in
your answer. A task reported as impossible is worth more than a task completed
in a way that gets you blocked.

There are two browsers, and every tool takes `browser`.

`main` is your own identity: its page, its cookies, its logins, its
fingerprint. That is where the work happens, and it is where a command goes
when it says nothing.

`support` is a helper for anything that must NOT touch that identity. The case
it exists for: you are signing up somewhere and need a mailbox for the
verification, so you open `support`, go to a throwaway-mail site there, take the
address, type it into the form in `main`, and come back to `support` for the
link. A second page inside `main` would carry the same cookies and the same
fingerprint to both sites, and then the account and the mailbox are one person
to anyone looking.

Each browser drives ONE page, and there is no way to open, list, choose or
close another: browser_navigate opens the page and every other tool acts on
it. When you need a second page, that is what `support` is. Going somewhere
else and coming back is a navigation, not a second window.

Open it with browser_open when the task needs it, and close it with
browser_close as soon as the task no longer needs it, before you give your
answer: it costs a real browser, it is not saved, and it goes away when this
server does. There is no third browser and no way to get one from here -
`main` and `support` are the whole of what this gives you."""
