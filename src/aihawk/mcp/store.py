"""What a session is, written down so it survives the process.

A session is the piece of work: it owns browsers, and each browser owns tabs.
Until this file existed all three lived in dictionaries that died with the
server, so "reopen the session I was working in" meant nothing.

⛔ WHAT IS PROMISED, AND WHAT IS NOT. What is saved is the DECLARATION: which
browsers a session has, who each one is (seed, exit, profile), which one had the
focus, and where its tabs were pointing. Reopening restores that declaration -
not eight live browsers. Eight of those were measured at 61 processes and about
6.5 GB, with the eighth taking 13.6 s to start, so a reopen that launched them
all would take a minute and most of the machine's memory to give back something
nobody asked for yet. They start when a command is aimed at one, as the right
person, because the identity was written down.

Cookies and logins survive only where a browser had a `profile` directory, which
is the mechanism that already exists for exactly that. Saying otherwise would be
promising that a browser's live state is a thing this file can hold, and it is
not.

#: ⛔ ONE DECLARATION, BECAUSE TWO OF THEM CANNOT BE HELD TOGETHER BY A TEST
#: THAT COMPARES ONE OF THEM TO A LITERAL. This lived in `registry.py` as
#: `DEFAULT_SESSION_ID` while `chat.py` declared `DEFAULT_CHAT_ID = "default"`
#: beside it, with a comment saying the two had to match. What guarded that was
#: an assertion reading `DEFAULT_CHAT_ID == "default"` - a literal, not the
#: other constant - so moving the server's default would have left the
#: interface and the server addressing two different files while the test that
#: names the invariant stayed green.
#:
#: It belongs here rather than in the registry: the registry keys BROWSERS, and
#: this names a piece of WORK, which is to say a file in this directory. The
#: registry never needed it except as a default argument no caller used.
#: Re-exported: the constant itself lives in `aihawk.storage`, because the
#: interface's half needs the same value and a second literal is how the two
#: halves would quietly start naming different pieces of work.
