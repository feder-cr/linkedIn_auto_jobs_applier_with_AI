"""One piece of work: the two browsers this process serves, and the file that
says who `main` is.

⛔ OPEN FIRST, AND NOTHING ELSE OPENS A BROWSER. Until 0.53.0 the lifecycle had
seven steps - declare, wake, look, act, rebuild, remember, close - because a
command aimed at a browser that was not running STARTED one, and an action
whose browser had died REBUILT it and ran the action again. Each of those was
a place to be wrong, and both were: the wake reopened pages the file had noted
and blamed the site for them; the rebuild fired on a domain that did not
resolve and threw away a healthy browser with its cookies ([B203]); a rebuild
was silent, then said, then a type. The owner cut it on 2026-09-14: a browser
is opened by `browser_open`, a tool whose browser is not open says so and says
what to call, and a browser that died says that instead and is not brought
back behind the model's back. What is left:

  open      `open(role, ...)` plans a browser and starts it; with no arguments
            it reopens `main` as the person this session already was.
  act       `acting(fn, ...)` runs one action on an open browser. Not open, or
            gone: the sentence, never a start and never a retry.
  look      `listing()` and `status()` describe what is open.
  remember  `open` writes who `main` is; nothing else writes the file.
  close     `close(role)` closes one browser and keeps who it was, so that a
            `browser_open` with no arguments brings the same person back;
            `close_all()` at the end of the process.

There is exactly one of these per process, because a process serves exactly
one piece of work; `server.py` builds it from `AIHAWK_SESSION_ID` and every
tool goes through it. A test builds its own with a factory that launches no
browser and installs it in the server's place.

#: TWO browsers in one piece of work, with fixed roles, and the number is a
#: decision rather than a measurement - the opposite of what it was until
#: 2026-09-11.
#:
#: It used to be eight, and the eight was measured: 61 processes and 6,515 MB,
#: the eighth taking 13.6 s to start against the first one's 6.8. Nothing about
#: that stopped being true. What changed is what a session MEANS. Identity lives
#: on the browser - seed, fingerprint, profile - so a session holding eight
#: browsers held eight identities while everything above it, the transcript and
#: the saved state and anything a person attaches to a session, was addressed
#: to one. "Whose is this?" had two possible answers and no way to choose.
#:
#: So a session is ONE identity, `main`, plus ONE helper beside it, `support`,
#: for the things that must not touch that identity: a temporary mailbox to
#: receive a verification, a lookup, a second opinion on a page. It is a
#: browser and not a tab because a tab would share cookies and fingerprint with
#: the site the identity is being built on, and the whole point of the helper
#: is that it does not. The helper is not saved - it dies with the process -
#: because a helper that survives IS a second identity, which is the thing this
#: number exists to rule out.
#:
#: The roles are NAMES A CALLER CANNOT INVENT. `browser` on every tool is a
#: closed choice, `main` or `support`, so nothing here ever holds a browser
#: called `b3` or `walmart-jobs` again.

#: were measured by getting them wrong: `binary_path` saved would reopen a
#: browser onto a path that means nothing on another machine, and `headless`
#: saved (until 0.50.0) made one headed run decide for every later process
#: that read the same file.
#:
#: ⛔ THESE ARE THE LAUNCH KWARGS' OWN NAMES, NOT THE TOOL ARGUMENTS' NAMES:

        listing answered `focus: "main"` from a literal, because the tools that
        moved a focus went with the eight-browser session on 2026-09-11 and
        nothing replaced them. The interface believed it: it draws a dot on
        that browser reading `the agent is working here`, so with `support`
        open the dot sat on `main` while the agent typed into the helper, and
        the screen marked current was `main` whatever the agent was doing.
        Saying where the work is happening is the whole job of that dot, and
        it was the one thing it could not do.

        The fact was already in `acting`, which every command that touches a
        page goes through and which knows the role of each one; it was simply
        thrown away. Nothing else had to be built.

        ⛔ AND IT NEVER NAMES A BROWSER THAT IS NOT OPEN. A browser can be
        closed or found gone after it was last acted in, and a focus pointing
        at one would put the dot on a screen the stage no longer draws. The
        fallback is `roles()` in order, so `main` wins whenever it is open -
        which is also where a command that names none goes.

        always `main`, it is a constant of the two roles rather than a fact
