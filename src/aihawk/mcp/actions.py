"""The browser operations, as plain functions over a session.

This module is the only implementation. The MCP tools in `server.py` are a thin
wrapper over it, and anything else that drives the browser - the built-in chat,
a test, a script - calls the same functions rather than reimplementing them.

That constraint is the point of the file. A second path to the page would give
two behaviours to keep in step, and they would drift: the tool would grow a
timeout the chat never got, the chat would grow a retry the tool never got, and
the difference would surface as a bug report nobody could reproduce.

Nothing here knows what MCP is, or what a session id is. It takes a session and
acts on it.

# ── evaluate, and the one thing it must not be used for ─────────────────────
#
# ⛔ THIS PACKAGE EXISTS SO THAT INTERACTION LOOKS REAL, AND A VALUE SET FROM
# SCRIPT IS THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. `el.value = 'beta'` changes the field without
# a keystroke, without focus, without a trusted event; `el.click()` fires a
# handler with `isTrusted === false`, which is one property read away from being
# the clearest bot signal a page can collect. Every other tool here goes through
# the humanised path - approach, hover, press, release - and this one would go
# around it.
#
# It is not a hypothetical. Measured 2026-09-02, first run with a real model:
# asked to pick an option from a dropdown, with no tool that could, it clicked
# the select, pressed ArrowDown twice, and then ran `s.value='beta'` through
# here. The model was not being careless - it was routing around a gap, which is
# what a capable model does. The gap is the defect; this refusal is what makes
# the gap visible instead of silently detectable.
#
# So the fix is in two halves and both are needed. The gaps are closed
# (`browser_select_option` exists, and the snapshot reports `checked` and the
# selected `value`, which is what sent it here to READ in the first place), and
# the shortcut is refused with the name of the tool to use instead. Closing the
# gaps alone leaves the shortcut for the next gap; refusing alone leaves the
# model stuck with a task it can see how to finish.
#
# ⛔ AND THIS IS A PATTERN CHECK, NOT A SANDBOX. JavaScript has unlimited ways
# to say the same thing and this catches the ones a model actually writes. It is
# a guardrail on the obvious road, not a wall around the field, and it must not
# be described as one anywhere.
