# Derived, never typed. This line said "0.1.0" through four releases - 0.2.0,
# 0.3.0, 0.4.0 and into 0.5.0 - because a hand-written literal is a second place
# the version lives, and the second place is the one nobody remembers to move.
# No test could see it either: every test imports the checkout, where the number
# is whatever the file says. It took installing the built wheel into an empty
# environment and asking the package what version it was.

#: ⛔ THE TWO SENTENCES EVERY TOOL CAN ANSWER INSTEAD OF WORKING, AND THEY LIVE
#: HERE RATHER THAN BESIDE THE CODE THAT SAYS THEM, because their readers are
#: far apart and only one of them is a person. A model acts on the words. The
#: live pane has to tell "there is nothing to look at" - draw the idle state,
#: quietly - apart from "something is wrong", which is a sentence somebody
#: reads; it compares against the first sentence, so the two cannot drift, and
#: put in `work.py` it would drag the engine's wrapper into the interface's
#: process just to read a string.
#:
#: Until 0.53.0 there were five sentences for "nothing is running" and none
#: for "it died", because a tool would START a browser when none was running
#: and REBUILD one that had died. Neither happens now: a browser is opened
#: with `browser_open` and with nothing else, and when it is gone the model is
#: told so and told what to do. That is the whole lifecycle.
