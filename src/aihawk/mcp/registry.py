"""The browsers, owned here rather than by whoever happens to be connected.

The server used to hold one browser in a module global and close it when the
client went away. That made the browser a property of the connection, which
blocked three things at once: only one client could ever attach, the browser
could not outlive the process that served it, and nothing but a tool call could
reach the page.

So browsers live here, by KEY, and a client is just something that borrows one.
Closing happens when the process shuts down, or when someone asks - not when a
client disconnects.

⛔ THE KEY IS OPAQUE HERE ON PURPOSE, and this class used to be called
`SessionRegistry` with a `session_id` on every method - a name from when one
entry really was one session. It is not: the server composes
`<piece of work>/<browser>`, so an entry is one BROWSER, and two of them
(`main` and `support`) belong to the one piece of work a process serves. What
this class knows is that equal keys are the same browser and different keys are
different browsers. Everything it gets right - one lock per key so two callers
racing start one browser rather than two, the configuration remembered so a
rebuild is the same person - follows from that and from nothing else.

        of succeeding without it. That is the intended trade: a suppressed
