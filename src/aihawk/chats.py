"""Where a CONVERSATION is written down, which is the interface's half.

⛔ THIS LIVED IN `aihawk.mcp.store` UNTIL 2026-09-13, AND NOTHING INSIDE THAT
PACKAGE EVER CALLED IT. Every caller of `save_chat`, `load_chat`,
`known_chats` and `erase_chat` was `chat.py` or `sessions.py`, which are the
interface. A module of the MCP server owned the interface's persistence, so
"what belongs to the protocol" and "what belongs to our product" could not be
told apart by reading the tree - the question this file exists to answer.

What did NOT move is the pairing itself, which is deliberate and is explained
where the browsers are written: the browsers are written by the MCP SERVER and
a conversation by the INTERFACE, which is a separate program reaching it over
stdio. One file with two writers is a race that costs somebody their
transcript on the day two writes land together, and neither process can take a
lock the other sees. So the session id is the join key, each writer owns its
own file, and the two live in separate directories.

The primitives both halves need - where the data lives, how an id becomes a
file name, how a file is replaced without a torn read - are in
`aihawk.storage`, imported by both and duplicated by neither.

What is saved is the transcript as the PAGE draws it plus the transcript as the
MODEL holds it. Saving only the first would give somebody back a conversation
they can read and cannot continue: the follow-up box would still be there,
meaning nothing.
