"""The things both halves of a session need to write themselves down.

A session is kept in two files by two programs: the browsers by the MCP
server (`aihawk.mcp.store`) and the conversation by the interface
(`aihawk.chats`). They must agree about WHERE the data lives and about HOW an
id becomes a file name, or the join between them breaks; and they must both
replace a file without ever leaving a half-written one behind.

⛔ THOSE THINGS WERE WRITTEN TWICE. `home()` and the id sanitiser lived in the
server's module and the interface reached into it to borrow them, which is how
the interface's persistence came to live inside the MCP package at all. The
atomic write was copied outright: four lines, in both files, with only one of
the two carrying the comment explaining why it has to be `write_bytes`. Two
copies of one rule is the arrangement where a fix reaches one of them.

⛔ AND READING WAS STILL WRITTEN TWICE UNTIL 0.56.0, which the first pass
missed because it was looking for duplicated VALUES rather than a duplicated
RULE. `store.load` and `chats.load_chat` were the same four lines with a
different path, and what they carry is not a value at all: it is the decision
that a file which will not parse is exactly as usable as one that was never
saved. Deleting was the same again. Both now live here, once.
