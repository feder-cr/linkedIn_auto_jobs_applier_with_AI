   ⛔ ONE PLACE, AND EVERY REQUEST GOES THROUGH IT. The server routes all read
   `?s=`, so a fetch that forgets it acts on the DEFAULT conversation while the
   page shows another - and the way that shows up is the picture on the right
   belonging to somebody else's browser, with nothing red anywhere. `at()` is
   the only thing that writes the parameter, so there is one place to be wrong
   and it is covered by a test that reads this file.

   The id is kept in the URL rather than in a variable, so a reload, a bookmark
   and a second tab all land in the same conversation instead of silently
   dropping to the default one.

   ⛔ AND A PAGE THAT NAMES NONE ASKS WITH NONE. The default conversation's
   id is the server's constant - `DEFAULT_SESSION_ID`, declared once there -
   and until 0.52.0 this line held a second copy of it, `'default'`, that
   nothing kept in step. A request with no `?s=` is answered with the
   server's default by the server's own rule, and the one place this page
   has to COMPARE against that id, the session column, learns it from the
   listing, which carries it. */
