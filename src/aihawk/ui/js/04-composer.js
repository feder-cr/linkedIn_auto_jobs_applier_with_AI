/* ⛔ NO NATIVE DIALOG, ANYWHERE ON THIS PAGE, AND THE REASON IS THE PRODUCT'S

   while one is up the frame pump stops, the transcript stops drawing, the step
   clock freezes - and the agent keeps working, server-side, the whole time. On
   a product whose claim is that you can watch it work, the two controls in the
   sessions panel and the one in the header stopped the watching. Walk away
   from an open dialog and the page is frozen for as long as you are gone.

   A second press instead. It is the pattern for a destructive control in a
   list, it needs no modal to build, and it leaves the page alive. The button
   says what the second press will do, so the sentence a `confirm` carried is
   not lost - it moves onto the control itself, where it is read by the eye and
   by a screen reader from the label.

   ⛔ AND IT DISARMS WHEN THE CONTROL LOSES THE FOCUS, NOT AFTER A NUMBER OF
   SECONDS. The first version gave it five, on the reasoning that a control
   left armed is one that gets pressed by somebody who has forgotten why it
   looks like that - which is the right worry and was the wrong remedy. A press
   on a control that has quietly disarmed ARMS IT AGAIN, so anybody slower than
   the timer can never reach the second press at all: measured while driving
   the running page, three presses and nothing happened, each of them more than
   five seconds after the last. And the reading is worse than the driving. The
   armed label is a sentence - `Press again to clear. The agent forgets
   everything you have told it. Its browsers stay open.` - which a screen
   reader takes some seven seconds to say, so it disarmed itself midway through
   announcing what the next press would do, locking out exactly the person who
   needed the sentence.

   A press moves the focus to what was pressed, so leaving it is what says the
   moment has passed - for a pointer and for a keyboard alike. There is no
