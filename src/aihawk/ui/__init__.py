"""The interface, as the files it is actually written in.

⛔ IT WAS ONE STRING IN A PYTHON MODULE, AND THEN TWO ENORMOUS FILES. First the
three languages came out of the literal in `web.py`; that left a 1023-line
stylesheet of 208 rules and a 1398-line script of 54 functions, each covering
seven unrelated areas with nothing but a comment between them. Those comments
were where the cuts went: the split follows the structure the code always had
rather than one invented for it.

⛔ AND THE ASSEMBLY IS BYTE FOR BYTE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE SAFETY OF BOTH MOVES.
595 assertions across fifteen gate files read this page as text, dozens of them
pinning exact strings of stylesheet and script - whole function signatures,
whole expressions, selectors. A restructuring that reworded any of that would
invalidate them wholesale, and rewriting the gates to match is how a suite stops
being evidence. Concatenation in a declared order changes no character, so every
one of those assertions still means what it meant.

⛔ THE ORDER IS DECLARED AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING. The script is one `<script>`
with top-level bindings, so a file that ran before its dependencies would break
the page in the way this project has recorded twice: an error at the top level
kills the whole file and the document still draws, so the suite stays green and
the page is dead. The lists below are the order the single file had.
