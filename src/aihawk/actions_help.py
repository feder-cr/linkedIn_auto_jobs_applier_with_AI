"""Turn a tool call into one readable line.

The difference between a step list somebody watches and a wall of JSON. The raw
arguments are already in the transcript the model sees; what the person on the
left needs is the target, in the shortest form that still identifies it.

Deliberately total: an unknown tool renders its arguments rather than raising or
printing nothing, because a new tool in the server must never make the UI go
quiet about what it just did.
