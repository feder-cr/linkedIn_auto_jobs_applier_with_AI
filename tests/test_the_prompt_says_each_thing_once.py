"""The model is told each thing once, and by whoever owns it.

⛔ THE SYSTEM MESSAGE IS TWO TEXTS GLUED TOGETHER, so a sentence in both is a
sentence the model reads twice in one message - and two copies of a rule are
two things to keep in agreement. The prompt used to open with "open the browser
with browser_open before anything else; if a tool answers that the browser is
not open or is gone, call browser_open and carry on", which is the server's
first paragraph said again a few lines above it.

⛔ AND THE SAME SENTENCE ABOUT `browser` CLOSED THIRTEEN TOOL DESCRIPTIONS,
word for word. That is thirteen places to change it, and it was spent out of
the wrong budget: a description is cut at 1024 characters before the model
reads it, and `browser_open` sat at 1021 - three characters from losing the
sentence that says who closes `support`, which is the defect its own gate was
written for. On the parameter it is said once and shown beside the argument it
describes, on every tool.

The rule about opening belongs to the SERVER: it is a fact about the tools, and
a standalone client that never sees the loop's prompt still has to be told it.
