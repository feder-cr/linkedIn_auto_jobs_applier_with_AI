"""Every tool the agent can call has a word a person recognises.

The step list is the whole interface: it is what a person watches while the
agent works, and it is the only place they can see something going wrong before
it finishes. A step that reads `Called selector=#sala, value=beta` is not
broken, it is just written in the machine's word order - which is the same
thing to whoever is reading it.

⛔ AND IT DEGRADES SILENTLY, which is why this is a test and not a habit.
`browser_select_option` was added to the server and the step list rendered it
through the fallback the very first time a model used it, with nothing red
anywhere. The verb table is in the page's JavaScript and the tool list is in
another package; the two can only disagree, never complain.

Reads the table out of the served page rather than importing a Python
constant, because the table a reader sees is the one in the page.
