"""One screen, or two, and which browsers are on them.

⛔ THE NUMBER OF SCREENS IS A MEASURED DECISION AND NOT A PREFERENCE. Every
frame goes down the same stdio pipe as every action, behind the same lock, so a
screen is pipe time the agent does not have for clicking. Measured on
2026-09-09 with four real browsers over the Link the interface itself uses: a
frame costs 5 to 6 ms - not the 22 ms this project assumed for months, because
the capture already runs inside the engine and the server hands over the latest
picture rather than taking one - and four panes polled flat out delivered 80
frames a second in total, about 20 each, with an action still landing in 49 ms
against 40 with a single pane. Four is affordable; eight would saturate the
pipe.

⛔ AND THE MEASUREMENT IS WHY THE NUMBER IS NOT A CHOICE ANY MORE. It was taken
when a session could hold up to eight browsers and a picker offered 1 / 2 / 4;
a session is `main` plus, while it is needed, `support`, so the layout follows
the fleet - two screens when the helper is up, one when it is not - and there
is nothing for a person to set. The numbers stay because they are what says
two panes are affordable.

What is executed here is the part that decides WHICH browsers are on the stage
and in what order, because that is the half a string scan cannot see: it is
arithmetic over the fleet, and getting it wrong shows up as a screen that is
blank, or as two panes that swap places while somebody is watching them.
