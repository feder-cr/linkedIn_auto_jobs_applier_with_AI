"""One screen, or two, or four, and which browsers are on them.

⛔ THE NUMBER OF SCREENS IS A MEASURED DECISION AND NOT A PREFERENCE. Every
frame goes down the same stdio pipe as every action, behind the same lock, so a
screen is pipe time the agent does not have for clicking. Measured on
2026-09-09 with four real browsers over the Link the interface itself uses: a
frame costs 5 to 6 ms - not the 22 ms this project assumed for months, because
the capture already runs inside the engine and the server hands over the latest
picture rather than taking one - and four panes polled flat out delivered 80
frames a second in total, about 20 each, with an action still landing in 49 ms
against 40 with a single pane. Four is affordable; eight would saturate the
pipe. That is why the control room's vocabulary, 1 / 2 / 4, is the one on
offer.

What is executed here is the part that decides WHICH browsers are on the stage
and in what order, because that is the half a string scan cannot see: it is
arithmetic over the fleet, and getting it wrong shows up as a screen that is
blank, or as the browser you clicked never coming to the front.
