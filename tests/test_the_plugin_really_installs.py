"""The plugin is INSTALLED and asked what it delivers, by the real client.

⛔ THIS IS THE TEST THE 1.0.0 PLUGIN NEEDED AND DID NOT HAVE, and the reason
it is worth its cost. That revision declared its server with
`"mcpServers": "./mcp.json"` in the manifest, which the Claude Code
documentation describes as supported. `claude plugin validate` passed. Every
check we had passed, because every check we had compared our files against our
own belief about somebody else's loader. Installed, it delivered
`MCP servers (0)`: zero tools, to everyone who took it.

Worse, the suite ASSERTED the broken shape. `plugin_findings` failed unless
the manifest carried that pointer, so removing it - the fix - would have gone
red, and the known-bad battery listed the INLINE form, which the documentation
recommends, among the mutations to reject. A mutation test proves a gate sees
what you told it to see. It cannot tell you that what you told it is true.

Measured 2026-09-13 on Claude Code 2.1.258, four plugins with distinct names
in one marketplace so no cache entry could collide, each in a throwaway
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`:

    .mcp.json at the plugin root ......................... MCP servers (1)
    "mcpServers": "./mcp.json" in the manifest ........... MCP servers (0)
    "mcpServers": {...} inline in the manifest ........... MCP servers (0)
    both files, which is what we ship .................... MCP servers (1)

So the documentation is ahead of the product, or wrong, on two of the three
forms it describes. That is exactly why this file executes the client instead
of reading the docs.

WHAT THIS COSTS AND WHERE IT RUNS. It needs the `claude` CLI, which a CI
runner does not have, so it skips there and runs for anyone who has it.
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` points at a temporary directory, so nothing here touches
the person's own plugins, marketplaces or settings - checked, not assumed, by
the last test below.

WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, said plainly: the marketplace is built from a COPY of
the files a Claude Code plugin consumes, not from the repository in place,
because a marketplace entry's source may not escape the marketplace root. The
copied set is derived from `PLUGIN_SURFACE` below and asserted to exist, so a
new component directory that nobody adds there would be invisible to this
test. It also does not start the server: `plugin details` reports the
configuration, and what happens after a client connects is
`tests/mcp_server/test_stdio_e2e.py`.
