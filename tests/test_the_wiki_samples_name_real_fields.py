"""A sample answer published in the wiki names fields the server still has.

⛔ MEASURED, AND IT HAD BEEN WRONG FOR THREE VERSIONS. `docs/writing-an-mcp-
client-in-python.md` publishes a transcript of driving this server, and the
`browser_list` line in it carried `running: false` - a field removed in 0.54.0
- inside a fleet holding a browser that a freshly started server has not had
since open-first landed in 0.53.0. Somebody following that page saw an answer
the product cannot produce.

Nothing was watching. The content gate anchors on the total character count of
the tool descriptions, which moves whenever a tool is added, removed or
reworded, and it caught the twelve pages that publish that number on the day
`browser_list` was rewritten. It cannot see a JSON sample: a sample is prose to
it.

So this asks the server what the answer looks like, rather than holding a list
of field names that would go stale the same way the samples did. What is
compared is the VOCABULARY - the keys, at both levels - and not the values: a
sample is allowed to show a different session than yours, and is not allowed
to show a field that does not exist.
