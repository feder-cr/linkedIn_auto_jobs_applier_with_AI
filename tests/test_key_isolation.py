"""The OpenRouter key must never reach the browser child process.

`runner.child_env` builds the environment handed to the stdio child that runs
`aihawk.mcp`, which in turn launches Firefox. The key belongs to
the parent only: the parent talks to OpenRouter, the child talks to a browser.
A commit in this repository calls the removal a security fix, and the history
carries a PR titled "Replace the committed API key", so the guarantee is not
theoretical.

Every test below names the known-bad input that breaks it. Two of them were once
xfail(strict=True), asserting leaks the code did not yet close; they are plain
assertions now, and the note above the line where they sat says when that
happened. This paragraph described the markers for some time after they were
gone, which is its own small version of the defect below.

⛔ AND HANDING OVER A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT IS ONLY HALF THE GUARANTEE, which is
what 0.68.2 shipped. Everything above the `forget_key` section asks the same
question - is the environment we GIVE the child clean - and the answer was yes,
in twenty-two ways. The child then read `.env` from the directory it inherited
and took the key back, so the process that launches Firefox held it anyway.
Nothing here could see that, because every test stopped at the handover.

So ONE test below spawns the real server as a subprocess. It is the only way to
ask what the child does after it starts, which is where the defect lived; it
starts no browser, and it ends by closing the child's stdin.

# The two xfails above this line were deleted when child_env started removing by
# value as well as by name. Mutating that code afterwards showed the suite was
# thinner than it looked: four of five mutations survived, and two of them
# survived because nothing here exercised the path at all.
#
# The rest survived because child_env removes the key three ways that overlap:
# collection is case-insensitive, removal by name is case-insensitive, and
# removal also matches by VALUE. Break any one and a lowercase variable is
# still removed by another, so the guarantee holds and the suite is right to
# stay green. Breaking two together does fail, which is what says the
# redundancy is real rather than a gate that cannot see.
#
# So these tests pin the GUARANTEE - after child_env, no variable carries the
# key, whatever it was called - and not the three mechanisms. Pinning each
# mechanism would assert the implementation, and would go red on a rewrite
# that kept the promise.
