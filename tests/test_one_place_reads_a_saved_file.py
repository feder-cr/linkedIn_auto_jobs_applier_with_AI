"""Both halves of a session read and delete their file through one function.

⛔ WHAT WAS DUPLICATED HERE WAS A RULE, NOT A VALUE, WHICH IS WHY THE FIRST
PASS MISSED IT. When `aihawk.storage` was carved out, the three things it took
were the ones that carry a VALUE somebody could get wrong: where the data
lives, how an id becomes a file name, how a file is replaced without a torn
read. Reading and deleting were left behind in both halves as four lines each,
and they looked like plumbing.

They are not plumbing. `load` answering None for a file that will not parse is
a DECISION - the alternative is raising on a server's first call because
something once wrote a broken byte - and it was written twice, in
`aihawk.mcp.store` and in `aihawk.chats`, with only one of the two explaining
itself. Deleting was the same again, and both copies answered a bool that
neither caller read and whose `False` meant "there was nothing there" and "it
could not be deleted", which are opposite news.

So this asserts the wiring rather than the behaviour: whatever the one
function does, both halves do. A copy coming back in either file is a copy
this cannot see any other way, because two identical implementations agree on
every input by construction - which is exactly why the duplication survived a
refactor that went looking for it.
