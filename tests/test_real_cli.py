"""A real browser, a real model, and one factual question about a page.

The loop, given a real browser and a real model, reads a page and answers
what is on it - the whole product in one assertion. It opens the same `Link`
the interface opens and runs the same loop the interface runs; the CLI wiring
around that is covered without a browser or a key in test_cli_surface.py.

Skipped unless both a real binary and a real key are present, because it spends
money and launches Firefox.
