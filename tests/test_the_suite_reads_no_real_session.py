"""The suite must not be able to see the session the person using AIHawk has.

⛔ A VERDICT THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE DEVELOPER LEFT OPEN IS NOT A VERDICT.
`tests/conftest.py` has pointed `AIHAWK_HOME` at a temporary directory since
sessions became persistent, and that covered every test BODY - but a fixture
runs when a test runs, and a module-level line runs when the file is IMPORTED,
which is earlier. One test module asks the server a question at import time,
that question reads the saved session, and so collection alone loaded the real
one: measured on the developer's machine, two tests in `test_addressing.py`
were red because the live session had its focus on a browser named after a job
search, and eight real URLs were carried into every test that followed. In
isolation they passed. On CI they passed, because CI has nothing saved to read.

This file is the gate for that, and it is deliberately not a scan for
module-level calls: it measures the property those calls depend on, which is
the same on every machine.

Known-bad: delete the `os.environ["AIHAWK_HOME"] = ...` line at the top of
`tests/conftest.py`. AT_IMPORT below then resolves to the platform's real
directory - `%APPDATA%/aihawk`, `~/.local/share/aihawk` - and the first
assertion goes red whether or not that directory happens to hold anything
today.

    `cli.ui` builds a `Sessions` registry and asks it for a conversation, so

    patched `aihawk.link.Link` instead stopped nothing: the command ran on,
