"""The exact bytes on the wire, which nothing else in this suite looks at.

⛔ EVERY OTHER TEST OF THE STREAM SPLITS ON `data: ` AND DECODES THE JSON, so it
sees the CONTENT and never the FRAMING: not the `id:` line that lets a dropped
connection resume where it was, not the blank line that ends an event, not the
order of the two, not which events are numbered and which are deliberately not.
A page that reconnects reads the framing and nothing else, so until this file
existed a change to it would have shipped green.

⛔ AND IT DRIVES THE APPLICATION DIRECTLY INSTEAD OF THROUGH A CLIENT. A test
client reassembles the response and hands back a decoded body, which is the
projection this file exists to stop looking at; it also runs the application in
another thread's event loop, where the conversation built here does not live.
`send` is called with the literal messages the framework emits, so what is
asserted below is what goes out.

Written as a characterisation test BEFORE the framing was moved into one
function, so that the move could be shown to change nothing rather than argued
to.
