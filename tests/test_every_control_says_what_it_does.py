"""Every control on the page says what it will do, before it is pressed and
after, and one rule says "this cannot be used".

Found by the UX audit of 2026-09-12, all on the running page: Enter queued a
sentence while the button looked exactly like Send; Clear went grey for a whole
run and never said why; the first-run example was drawn as a chip and did
nothing when clicked; a failed load of the session list looked like an empty
one; the largest motion on the page ignored the reduced-motion setting because
it was asked for in script; and four rules spelled "cannot be used" with two
different numbers.

Executed rather than read wherever a fact is about what a handler DOES: the
text of `paint` says nothing about which mode it will pick, and the text of a
click handler says nothing about whether it fires the request.
