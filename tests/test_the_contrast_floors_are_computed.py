"""The ink of this page is measured here, not described in a comment.

⛔ THIS IS THE MOST REPEATED DEFECT IN THE STYLESHEET AND NOTHING WAS WATCHING
IT. `01-tokens.css` carries two separate blocks about the same thing: a token
declared DECORATION ONLY ended up colouring words - nine rules at 2.4:1 where
AA asks 4.5, among them the address that is printed precisely so an injected
link can be read, which was the hardest thing on the page to read - and then
the same class again one rung up, a graphic measured against the ground instead
of against the surface it is painted on.

Both were found by somebody looking. The file records the ratios it relies on
as numbers written into comments, and nothing recomputes them: this project
refuses a hand-written count in its documentation and had no opinion about one
in its stylesheet.

So this computes them. Three halves:

  * every ratio the file PUBLISHES is recomputed and has to match, because a
    comment that has gone stale is worse than no comment - it is evidence that
    was true once;
  * the floors for the roles the file itself declares, against the surfaces it
    itself names;
  * and the rule that has been broken twice, made mechanical: the decorative
    token never sets `color` anywhere.

The arithmetic is WCAG 2.x relative luminance, which is what every source the
file cites is quoting.
