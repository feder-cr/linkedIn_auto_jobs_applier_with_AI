"""The conversation service behind the interface: what it emits, and stopping it.

No browser and no model. The Link is a double that records the tool calls it was
asked for, and the Brain is whatever the test needs it to be, so what is under
test is the service's own behaviour: the order of the events, which of them are
part of the transcript, and whether a run can actually be interrupted.

Every test here covers something the redesign INTRODUCED. The page was rebuilt
around events that did not exist the day before - `you` from the server, a replay
flag, a usage line, a stop route - and behaviour that arrives with a page and no
tests is a claim rather than a feature.
