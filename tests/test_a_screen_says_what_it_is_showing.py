"""What a screen looks like when it has nothing to show, and what shape it takes.

⛔ FOUR STATES USED TO DRAW ONE BLACK RECTANGLE. A pane waiting for its first
frame, a browser with no tab open, one that stopped answering and a capture that
failed were pixel-identical: an empty dark box with a name under it. Three of
those four are ordinary and one is a failure, and the product said the same
thing about all of them - which is how a pane that is simply patient came to
look like a pane that is broken.

⛔ AND THE CELL USED TO BE A CONTAINER, NOT A FRAME. Measured on the bench: a
1280x688 window in a one-up cell drew 40% of the card as black, and at two-up two
cards of equal size held pictures of unequal size, so the smaller one read as a
mistake rather than as a narrower window. The frame now takes the picture's own
shape, cropped of the browser chrome, and the whole of it is executed here
rather than described - it is arithmetic over two natural dimensions.
