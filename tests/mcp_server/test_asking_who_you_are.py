"""Being able to ASK who is browsing, which for a long time was impossible.

⛔ THE IDENTITY WAS REPORTED EXACTLY ONCE, in the return value of `session_start`
- a call the tool descriptions explicitly say you do not have to make. So on the
path the surface itself recommends, a model had no way at all to learn its own
seed, its exit or its profile, and `identity.py` promised in capitals that a
drawn seed is ALWAYS reported while being unreachable from that path.

Three things have to hold, and the third is the one that is easy to get wrong:

  1. with a session running it reports the identity, the exit and the profile;
  2. with nothing running it says so, rather than inventing an answer;
  3. it STARTS NOTHING. A tool that launches a browser to answer "who am I"
     changes the thing it was asked about, and would draw and persist an
     identity as a side effect of a question.
