"""A session outlives the server: what it held is written down and read back.

Until this, a session was a dictionary that died with the process. "Reopen the
one I was working in" meant nothing, and the identity a session had spent an
hour building - the seed, the exit, the profile with the logins in it - was
gone the moment the server stopped.

⛔ WHAT IS PROMISED IS THE DECLARATION, NOT EIGHT LIVE BROWSERS. Eight of those
were measured at 61 processes and about 6.5 GB, the eighth taking 13.6 s to
start, so a reopen that launched them all would spend a minute and most of the
machine to hand back something nobody has asked for yet. A reopened browser is
a promise about WHO it will be; the engine starts when a command is aimed at it.
Three tests below hold that line, because it is the kind of thing a later reader
"fixes" into eagerly starting them.

No browser starts here. The registry is built by the server's own constructor -
so the wiring that writes sessions down is the wiring under test - with a
factory that launches nothing.

`tests/conftest.py` points `AIHAWK_HOME` at a temporary directory for every
test in the package. Without it these write into the developer's real
`%APPDATA%`, which is not a hypothetical: they did, on the first run.

    """⛔ THE ENGINE IS A PROPERTY OF THE PROCESS, NOT OF THE SESSION, and
    leaving it out of the FILE was read as leaving it out of the BROWSER.

    `WHO_A_BROWSER_IS` keeps `binary_path` out of what a session writes down,
    and rightly: it is a path on THIS machine, and a session carried to another
    one must resolve an engine rather than insist on a path that means nothing
    there. But a browser restored from that file was then declared without an
    engine at all, so it came back on whatever the seal resolved instead of on
    the one the person had named.

    Measured 2026-09-09, and not only a developer's problem: somebody running
    `aihawk ui --binary <their build>` and reopening a session got browsers on a
    DIFFERENT engine, silently. On a locally built one - a seal with no
    published assets - they got no browser at all, because there was nothing to
    download and nothing to run. The interface's own agent hit it live and
    worked around it by closing and reopening every browser under the same name,
    which works precisely because `browser_open` goes through the launch plan
    and a restore does not.

    Same shape as the system prompt a saved conversation used to carry back in
    place of the current one: the file says what happened, the build says what
    it runs on.
