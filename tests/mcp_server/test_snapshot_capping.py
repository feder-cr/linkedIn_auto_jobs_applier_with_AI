"""An over-long answer is shortened by dropping elements, not by cutting text.

The defect, measured 2026-09-02: the answer was serialized in full and then, if
it exceeded the cap, replaced by an envelope holding a SLICE of the JSON string.
A slice of JSON is not JSON, so on any page above the cap the caller received
zero usable elements. Not the first fifty: zero.

How close that cap sat, with the fields the snapshot returns today: about 112
characters per element, so the old default of 6000 ran out at around fifty. A
real results page passes that without effort, and one page in the test corpus
carried 118.

A partial list a model can act on beats a complete one it cannot read.
