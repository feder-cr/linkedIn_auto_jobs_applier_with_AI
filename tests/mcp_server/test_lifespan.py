"""The lifespan must NOT close the sessions, and that is the whole point.

FastMCP runs the lifespan per MCP session, which is per CLIENT rather than once
per process. Measured while building this: with one client attached the machine
had 7 firefox processes, and a second after that client disconnected it had 1
again, because the lifespan was closing the registry. A browser that dies when
somebody detaches cannot be shared, cannot outlive a chat, and cannot back a
live view.

So these tests assert the absence of a behaviour. They fail against any version
that cleans up here, including the one this replaced.

    """Without this the browsers would simply leak: Firefox launches a tree of
    processes, and an orphan goes on holding its profile directory and port.

    ⛔ THIS TEST DID NOT TEST ITS OWN NAME. It asserted only that
    `_close_sessions_at_exit` EXISTS and is callable, which stays true if the
    `atexit.register` line is deleted - the leak it is named for would ship
    green. Above it sat a dead `registered = ...` line, a first attempt at
    reading `atexit._exithandlers` that CPython does not expose, left in place
    with a comment explaining the retreat.

    ⛔ AND THE OBVIOUS REPLACEMENT IS INERT ON THIS INTERPRETER, which is worth
    writing down because it looks like it works. `atexit.unregister(f)` then
    comparing `atexit._ncallbacks()` reads like a behavioural proof; measured
    on CPython 3.12.0, the count does NOT go down after `unregister` - not for
    this function and not for a freshly registered local one either. A test
    built on it fails against correct code, which is the worst kind of gate:
    it accuses the product of the defect it was written to find.

    So this reads the SOURCE, which is what this suite already does elsewhere
    for properties no behaviour test can reach (`test_addressing.py` scans the
    same module for unaddressed registry calls). Over the AST rather than for
    a substring, because this project has a recorded case of a gate satisfied
    by the COMMENT next to the call it was checking for.

    Known-bad: comment out `atexit.register(_close_sessions_at_exit)` in
    `mcp/server.py`. The old assertion stayed green; this one goes red.
