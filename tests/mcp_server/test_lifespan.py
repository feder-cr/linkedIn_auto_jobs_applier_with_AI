"""The lifespan must NOT close the sessions, and that is the whole point.

FastMCP runs the lifespan per MCP session, which is per CLIENT rather than once
per process. Measured while building this: with one client attached the machine
had 7 firefox processes, and a second after that client disconnected it had 1
again, because the lifespan was closing the registry. A browser that dies when
somebody detaches cannot be shared, cannot outlive a chat, and cannot back a
live view.

So these tests assert the absence of a behaviour. They fail against any version
that cleans up here, including the one this replaced.
