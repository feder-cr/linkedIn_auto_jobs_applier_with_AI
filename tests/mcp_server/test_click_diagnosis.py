"""A click that does not land has to say what stopped it.

Playwright reports a failed click as "not actionable in 15s after N attempts",
which tells a caller that something is wrong and nothing about what. Measured
across eighteen real sites, four clicks failed and every one failed that way: a
logo, a footer link, a shipping button. Fifteen seconds spent to learn nothing.

The answer worth having is `covered_by`. If a cookie banner is sitting over the
button, the next move is to dismiss the banner, and that is a different action
from retrying - which is what a caller does with an opaque timeout.
