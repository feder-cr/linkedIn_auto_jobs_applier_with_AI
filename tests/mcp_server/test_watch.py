"""`browser_watch`: the window as a person sees it, from a live capture.

Every image this server returned was `page.screenshot()`, the content
viewport, and the pointer is drawn outside the page on purpose - so whoever
was watching an agent work never saw where the pointer was. The engine's
screencast captures the WINDOW; the session keeps one running per tab and
answers the latest frame.

Unit half, no browser: a fake page whose `screencast` records what it was
asked. Known-bad inputs run before this file was trusted:

* `watch_frame` starting the capture on EVERY call -> the "started once" test
  goes red (and a real engine would refuse the second start);
* the capture not stopped in `close_page` -> the stop test goes red;
* the size bound dropped -> the first test goes red, and a real 1920x1080
  window would ship a JPEG four times larger than needed on every call.
