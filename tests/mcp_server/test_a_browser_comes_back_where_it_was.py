"""Waking a declared browser gives back the person AND the pages.

Slice 3 made a saved session give back WHO its browsers were. That is half of
what somebody reopens a session for: a browser that comes home as the right
person with nothing open is right about its identity and wrong about its work.
This file is the other half - where it was.

⛔ AND IT HAPPENS ONCE. A browser that kept reopening the tabs a file remembers
would fight whoever is using it, closing nothing and adding the same pages back
every time it was handed out. The tabs are OWED, and the wake that pays them
clears the debt.

No browser starts here: the registry is given a factory that launches nothing,
and its sessions record the pages they were asked to open.
