"""A session holds two browsers with fixed roles: opening, closing, the ceiling.

The addressing that makes this possible is pinned in `test_addressing.py`; this
file is about the layer above it, where a session owns browsers and has to say
how many, which one, and what happens when one is closed.

⛔ THE CEILING IS A DECISION AND THE TESTS TREAT IT AS ONE. It was eight and
eight was measured - 61 processes, 6.5 GB, the eighth taking twice as long to
start as the first - and none of that stopped being true. What changed is that
a session IS an identity, `main`, with one helper beside it, `support`, for
what must not touch that identity. So the refusal carries the way OUT rather
than the cost, and one test reads it.

No browser starts here. The registry gets a factory that launches nothing, so
what a tool did is observable as the keys the registry ends up holding.
