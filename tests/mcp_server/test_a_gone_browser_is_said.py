"""A browser that REALLY dies says so, against a real engine.

⛔ THE SENTENCE A MODEL ACTS ON, PROVEN WHERE IT COMES FROM. `Work.acting`
turns a dead browser into `GONE`, and `test_open_first.py` proves that against
a stand-in whose `is_alive()` the test flips and whose action raises
`TargetClosedError` because the test made it. Neither of those is the thing
that happens in the world: what happens is that Firefox goes away - crashed,
or a window closed by hand - and what the wrapper raises then is a fact about
the wrapper, not about this package. Between the two halves, each tested
against a double, sat the join: if a killed engine surfaced as anything else,
every model driving this server would get a traceback where it needed an
instruction, and no test here would have moved.

So these kill the browser for real, and there are TWO of them because the
sentence has two paths and a killed process reaches them in a definite order.
Measured while writing this: with the engine ended from outside, an action
raises `TargetClosedError` and `acting` translates it - the aliveness check
does not fire first, and dropping it leaves the first test green. The second
test is the one that holds it, by asking a question that runs no action at
all. One path each, one mutation each.

⛔ AND THEY KILL ONLY WHAT THEY STARTED. This machine runs two Claude
sessions, each with its own MCP server and its own Firefox processes, and this
project has a rule about that written from an incident: record the pids that
are ALIVE before the launch and end only what was born after. Nothing else is
touched, and what these start is ended whether they pass or not.
