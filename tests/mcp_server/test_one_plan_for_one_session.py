"""What a session is told must be what the browser was launched with.

⛔ THESE ARE ALL THE SAME DEFECT SEEN FROM DIFFERENT SIDES. The tool that starts
a session decided from its ARGUMENTS while the browser launched from
`launch_kwargs(os.environ)`, so the two drifted the way two copies of a fact
always drift. The worst of it was not a confusing sentence:

  * with a profile set in the environment the identity decision never saw it, so
    the seed was drawn fresh every session while the cookie jar persisted. One
    login, three fingerprints. That is the exact tell `identity.py` exists to
    prevent, reintroduced by the code that called it.
  * the answer said `profile: none, so nothing survives this session` over a
    browser holding a persistent profile.
  * a caller could not turn OFF an environment profile, because `if profile:`
    cannot tell "I said no" from "I said nothing".

`plan_session` is now the only thing that decides, and `describe` reads the
kwargs it produced rather than the arguments that produced them. No browser
starts here: that is the point of having one pure function decide.
