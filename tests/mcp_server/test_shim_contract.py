"""`aihawk` is the one command this package declares, and the old name is a
shim over it.

New registrations use `uvx aihawk`, and the interface spawns `python -m aihawk`:
the group with no subcommand serves over stdio, `aihawk ui` is the interface,
and there is no second script and no `aihawk.mcp` command - pinned here.

The PyPI package invisible-playwright-mcp ships, since its 0.16.0, three files
that re-export `aihawk.mcp.server` and a console script that points at
`aihawk.mcp.server:main` (a module path, not a command); every client that
registered `uvx invisible-playwright-mcp` before this package went to one
command still runs through those names. The shim lives in an archived
repository and cannot follow a rename, so the names it binds are pinned here
too.
