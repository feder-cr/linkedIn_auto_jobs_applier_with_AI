"""A question is not a command: looking at a browser must not create one.

⛔ THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR SHIPPED IN 0.36.0, 0.37.0 AND 0.38.0, AND NOTHING
IN THE SUITE COULD SEE IT. Opening the interface drew its panes, the panes asked
`browser_watch` and the tab tool of the day, both resolved their browser through
`ready`, and `ready` STARTS what it resolves. Measured on 0.38.0 with a fresh
home and no instruction given: 9 firefox processes before, 16 after - roughly
800 MB and seven seconds - and `browser_watch` then answered an error, so the
engine the look had started was not even used for the look.

Every test that touched those tools built a registry whose factory launches
nothing, so "it started a browser" was invisible: nothing launched in the first
place. What IS visible, and is what these assert, is whether the registry ends
up holding a session it did not hold before. That is the same event one layer
up, and it is the layer where it can be proven without a browser.

The other half of the rule is asserted too, because a guard that never lets
anything through is not a guard: a browser that IS running is looked at exactly
as before.
