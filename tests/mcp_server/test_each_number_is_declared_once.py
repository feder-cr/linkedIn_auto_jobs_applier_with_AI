"""A number the model is told is the number the code uses.

⛔ THE CAP WAS WRITTEN THREE TIMES: `DEFAULT_MAX_CHARS` in `actions.py`, the
default in `browser_read_text`'s signature, and the digit in its description.
The signature was a copy nothing read back, so it could drift from the constant
in silence and the tool would honour a number its own module did not declare.
It reads the constant now.

The DIGIT in the prose stays, and a draft that deleted it was wrong: the schema
does publish the default, but `test_the_two_readers_do_not_pretend_to_share_a
_cap` holds that this description declares its cap while `browser_read_html`
declares it has none, because a reader shown one and not the other assumes
symmetry and the two differ by 34x on a large page. A number with a reason to
be written twice gets a gate rather than a deletion.
