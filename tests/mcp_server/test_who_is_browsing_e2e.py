"""The identity tools, driven through the protocol with a real browser.

⛔ EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS FEATURE IS TESTED WITHOUT A BROWSER, and that was
the gap. `plan_session` is a pure function and the registry takes a stand-in, so
both are covered fast and offline - which is why they were written that way. But
nothing had ever asked the question that matters: does the seed a caller passes
actually reach the engine and change what a page sees?

A test that only asks "did it launch" cannot tell a working identity from a
constant one. So the shape here is the one this project calls realness rather
than absence:

  * the SAME seed twice must produce the SAME fingerprint, and
  * a DIFFERENT seed must produce a DIFFERENT one.

The second half is what makes the first meaningful. A build that ignored the seed
entirely would pass determinism perfectly and fail here, and a build that
randomised every launch would fail the first. Neither could pass both.

Skipped unless a real binary is present, because it launches Firefox three times.

    same defect `pythonpath` was added to close, one layer further out.

    hold an editable install pointing at this tree. That is luck of the venv,
