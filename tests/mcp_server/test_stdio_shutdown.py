"""Closing stdin ends the server, browser included, within a bounded time.

Closing the input stream is the first step of the shutdown the MCP spec
prescribes to a stdio client (then SIGTERM, then SIGKILL). Measured on Linux
on 2026-09-06: with a page open, the server was still alive 180 seconds after
its stdin closed, and the browser with it, because the close of every browser
was left to an atexit hook that ran registry.close_all() in a NEW event loop
over Playwright objects born in the loop that had just finished; that await
never returned. With no page ever opened the process exited in 0.2 s, and on
SIGTERM it exited at once, which is why no client had noticed.

Skipped unless STEALTHFOX_BINARY points at a real patched Firefox build: the
page has to be real for the close to have anything to wait for.
