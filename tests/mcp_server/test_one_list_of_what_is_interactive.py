⛔ IT WAS DECLARED TWICE, IN TWO LANGUAGES, AND THEY DISAGREED. `clean.py` held
nineteen roles for the sieve; the snapshot's selector held seven, typed out by
hand inside a JavaScript string in another module. Nothing could compare them,
so nothing did.

Measured 2026-09-15 by driving a page of ARIA controls through the real server:
a `role=combobox` and a `role=slider` with no `tabindex` came back from
`browser_read_html` and were absent from `browser_snapshot` - which is the tool
the instructions name as the way to find something to click. Seven controls in
all, invisible to the rung the ladder starts on, while the sieve saw every one.

The two need the same list with ONE difference, and the difference is now
NAMED rather than left to a second list to imply: roles whose members come in
hundreds are kept by the sieve and left out of the inventory.
