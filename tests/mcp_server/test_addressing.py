"""Every tool addresses ONE browser, and a caller that names none reaches `main`.

The registry has kept browsers by key since it was written, and it already gets
the hard parts right: one lock per key so two callers racing start one browser
rather than two, the configuration remembered so a rebuild is the SAME PERSON,
tab numbering that does not restart across a rebuild. All of it was unreachable,
because every tool called `registry.ensure()` with no argument. The key is now
composed by `addressed(browser_id)` from this process's own identity plus the
one optional parameter every tool publishes, `browser`, so that behaviour works
per browser without a line of the registry moving.

⛔ THE FAILURE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR IS SILENT. One call left without an address
reads one browser while the calls around it write another: no exception, no red
test, just a tool answering confidently about the wrong page. Behaviour tests
only cover the calls somebody thought to test, so the last two tests read the
SOURCE and refuse a registry call that carries no address, and a tool that
reaches the registry without offering a way to say which browser it means.

No browser starts here. The registry takes a factory and the actions are
replaced by a stub that answers with the browser it was handed, so what a tool
did is observable as the browser it reached for.
