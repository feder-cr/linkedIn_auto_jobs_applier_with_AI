"""Several browsers, one live pane, and the arithmetic that decides it.

⛔ THE SHAPE OF THIS FEATURE COMES FROM A NUMBER, NOT FROM TASTE. A frame costs
about 22 ms on the stdio pipe, the pipe is serialised, and actions share it with
pictures. Eight panes each asking thirteen times a second is 104 requests a
second at 22 ms, which is 2.3 seconds of pipe for every second that passes: the
picture falls behind and every click queues behind the pictures. So there is one
live pane and one slow loop that takes the others in turn at a FIXED rate, and
the test below reads that out of the page - because the obvious way to write it
is a loop per pane, whose cost is exactly what the measurement forbids.
