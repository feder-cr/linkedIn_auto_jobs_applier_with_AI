"""A restart is not a reason to throw away a sentence somebody typed.

⛔ ONE WORD MEANT TWO THINGS. `fresh` is what the server sends when somebody
presses Clear, and it is also what it sends to a page that reconnects holding a
position from another transcript - which is what a restarted process looks like
from the outside. The page answered both by wiping, and wiping dropped the
queued message. So a follow-up typed while the agent was working disappeared on
the next restart, with nothing said: the one thing this interface argues
everywhere it must not do, on the feature built precisely because "a reload ate
it".

The reason travels in the TEXT rather than in a new kind, the way `busy`
already carries "1" and "0". That is not a shortcut: a page older than the
server would draw an event kind it has never heard of into the transcript as a
sentence, because the dispatcher is deliberately total. An older page seeing
`fresh` keeps doing exactly what it did before.

The same reasoning is why the server's build travels as a FIELD on a poll the
page already makes rather than as an event.
