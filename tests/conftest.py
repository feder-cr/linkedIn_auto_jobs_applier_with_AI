"""No test reads or writes the real machine's aihawk directory.

⛔ MEASURED, BY DOING IT. Sessions became persistent on 2026-09-08, and the
first run of the tests that exercise them wrote three real files into
`%APPDATA%\\aihawk\\sessions` on the developer's machine - and then the next
test read them back, so tests began contaminating each other through a
directory none of them had mentioned. One of them failed with six browsers it
never opened.

Redirected here rather than in each test for the reason the pollution happened
at all: the tests that touch this were written by somebody who knew about it,
and the ones written next year will not be. `AIHAWK_HOME` is the single knob
`store.home()` reads first, so pointing it at a temporary directory for every
test closes the whole class rather than the two cases somebody remembered.

⛔ AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THAT ONLY COVERED TEST BODIES, WHICH LET THE SAME
DEFECT BACK IN THROUGH THE DOOR NEXT TO IT. A fixture runs when a test runs; a
module-level line runs when the file is IMPORTED, which is before any fixture
exists. `test_asking_who_you_are.py` asks the server one question at import
time, and that question reads the saved session - so on a machine where
somebody actually uses AIHawk, collection alone loaded the real one. Measured
on this machine: two tests in `test_addressing.py` went red because the
developer's live session had its focus on a browser called `b-kw-pharmacist`,
and the server module carried that, plus eight real URLs, into every test that
followed. Green in isolation, red in the suite, and green on CI - because CI
has no saved session to read. A suite whose verdict depends on what the
developer left open is not reporting on the product.

So the home is redirected TWICE, and the two are not redundant:

* at import, below, so no line that runs during collection can reach the real
  directory. This one is a single directory for the whole run, which is enough
  because its only job is to be empty;
* per test, in the fixture, so two tests cannot reach each other's.

And the module state the server keeps ACROSS calls is emptied per test for the
same reason the environment variable is set in one place: several test files
already reset those dicts by hand, which is the duplication that lets the next
file forget. What one test leaves behind is not an input to the next one.

    ⛔ THIS USED TO ASK THE OTHER QUESTION - "did somebody ask for an engine" -
    and both of its answers were wrong in a way that mattered.

    `-m "not (e2e or ui)"` deselects both and it answered YES, somebody asked:
    the parentheses were stripped before the walk, so the `not` landed on `e2e`
    alone and `ui` read as a bare request. The guard was then off for a run that
    could not start a browser at all - exactly the run it exists for. And
    `-m "not ui"` SELECTS the engine tests while answering no, so the guard
    armed and they died on the one second download deadline.

    One notion fixes both, and it is the one the guard actually needs: arm when
    the engine tests are not going to run. A plain `pytest -q` gets there
    through `addopts`, which never reaches argv - hence the default.

    A token walk and not a regular expression: the gate in
    `test_the_suite_reads_no_real_session.py` holds this file to the imports a
    `pip install pytest` job has, and `re` would pass on the merits - it is
    stdlib - but the cheapest way to keep a gate strict is to never ask it for
    an exception.
