"""The two things a page has to get right before anything else it does.

⛔ CONTRAST AND TARGET SIZE ARE ARITHMETIC, WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE HERE. Every
other judgement about this interface is a matter of taste and belongs in a
screenshot; these two are numbers with a threshold, and a threshold that nobody
computes is a threshold that drifts. WCAG 2.2 asks 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for a
graphic that carries meaning, and 24 by 24 pixels for anything you have to hit.

Measured on the running page before this was written: the state beside the
browser read at 2.23:1, the token meter at 2.71, the placeholder inside a screen
at 2.51, the layout icons at 2.51 - and nine more rules had put words on the ink
this file's own palette annotates as `decorative only`. The worst of them was
`.href`, the address printed beneath a link precisely so that an injected one
can be read; it was the hardest text on the page to read.
