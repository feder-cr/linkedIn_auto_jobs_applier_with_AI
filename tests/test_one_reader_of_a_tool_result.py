"""A tool result is read in one place, and this is how that stays true.

⛔ THE GATE NEXT DOOR CANNOT SEE THIS ONE. `test_the_product_surface_is_what
_the_product_uses` asks whether a name has a caller in the product, which
catches a surface that is dead. A DUPLICATED surface answers yes: both copies
are named, both are called, both have tests, and the suite is green whichever
one drifts.

What was actually there, until this file existed: three readers of one wire
format.

  * `link.text_of` - the text of a result, with a docstring saying it was
    "shared with the agent loop rather than written twice: a tool result is
    read in two places now, and two readers of one wire format drift".
  * `agent._result_text` - the same five lines written out again, the
    `[non-text result]` literal included, importing nothing from `link`. The
    sentence above was not describing the code; it was describing an intention.
  * `routes.frame` - `text_of(result) if getattr(result, "isError", False)
    else ""`, reading the flag for itself beside a call to the shared reader.

So the question here is structural rather than nominal: WHO KNOWS what an MCP
tool result looks like? The answer has to be `link.py`, and one module is a
thing that can be asserted.

⛔ AND IT READS THE SYNTAX, NOT THE TEXT, because this project has recorded the
gate-accused-by-a-comment defect more times than any other and the prose here is
full of the very words being searched for - this docstring included. `isError`
inside a sentence is not an attribute access and not a string equal to
"isError", so an AST walk cannot be fooled by either, in either direction: it
also cannot be SATISFIED by a comment mentioning the name.
