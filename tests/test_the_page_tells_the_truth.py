    Measured 2026-09-12 in a real browser at eight widths, drawer open: 240px
    off the front of every line at every desktop width - 48% of the measure at
    1440px, 61% at 960px, 29 rows buried at once and one of them whole. The
    owner read it off his own screen before any gate did: lines beginning
    `.com/it/ navigated to`, with the verb and the step number underneath the

    The gate that stood here asserted that the drawer stopped SHORT of the

    cannot be asked: with the page behind it inert, the panel may cover the
    input, because the input is out of play anyway. So the property moved. It
    is no longer where the panel stops, it is what it holds while it is up.

    Three things are executed rather than read, because the text cannot answer
    any of them: that opening holds both panes and closing releases them, that
    the keyboard goes in and comes back, and that a hold SOMEBODY ELSE is
    keeping survives this panel letting go of its own. The last one is why
    `outOfPlay` exists at all - a conversation deleted in another tab holds the
    browser pane, and a plain `inert = false` from here would bring that pane
    back fully lit on a page where nothing is live.

    Known-bad, all three run: write `box.inert = open` in place of the call to
    `outOfPlay` and the deleted pane revives; drop the `hadFocus` check and the
