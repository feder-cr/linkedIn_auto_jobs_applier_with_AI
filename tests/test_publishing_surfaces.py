"""The two listings this package publishes to describe the version that ships.

Two files in this repository are read by somebody else's machine, not by ours:

  1. `server.json` at the root is what `mcp-publisher` sends to the Official
     MCP Registry, and the registry checks the PyPI package it names for a
     `mcp-name: <server name>` token in the published description, which is
     README.md. A version in server.json that is not the version on the index
     is refused by the registry; a missing token is refused too, with
     "Registry validation failed for package".
  2. `manifest.json` at the root makes the repository itself the MCP bundle
     (MCPB manifest 0.4, server.type "uv"): `scripts/pack_bundle.py` zips
     the tracked tree minus `.mcpbignore`, and a host runs the server from
     the archive with `uv run --directory <bundle> python -m aihawk`, which
     installs the package from the bundle's own `pyproject.toml`. Until
     2026-09-13 the bundle was a separate `mcpb/` folder whose pyproject
     pinned the published package - a pointer to PyPI, spec-valid but not
     the layout the spec describes, and `type: python` with nothing bundled,
     which the spec forbids. Now the manifest carries a copy of the version
     and the archive carries the source.

That is three copies of one number (pyproject, server.json, the manifest)
and one token that must match a name. Each pair was written by hand on
2026-09-12 and they agreed; nothing made them agree. The registry job in
publish.yml runs on the tag, which is after the bump, and would only find out
at the end of a release. This test finds out on the pull request.

  3. Since 2026-09-13, five manifests at the root are read by plugin loaders
     and directory crawlers: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (Claude Code plugin,
     which points at `mcp.json`), `plugin.json` and `mcp.json` (the Agent
     Plugins standard, which cursor.directory scans for), `.cursor-plugin/
     plugin.json` (Cursor's marketplace) and `gemini-extension.json` (the
     Gemini CLI gallery, which crawls the `gemini-cli-extension` topic). None
     of them carries the package version - a manifest that just says `uvx
     aihawk` does not change per release - but every one of them repeats the
     package name, the one-line description and the launch command, and the
     bundle manifest repeats the description too. Those are the copies this
     file makes agree.

Every check is a function over strings and dicts, and a second test feeds them
known-bad input: a check that has only ever said "consistent" is not a check.

#: No `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` since 2026-09-13 night: Cursor's own docs say
#: "A plugin that follows the Agent Plugins specification loads in Cursor
#: without changes", and that manifest is their format for rules, agents,
#: commands and hooks, none of which this plugin has. cursor.directory's scan
#: read `plugin.json` and `mcp.json` and never the logo that file carried.

#: directory never shows the README where that block lives. The block itself
#: is held identical to the README's by scripts/check_content.py, which scans

#: ⛔ TWO NAMES FOR ONE CONFIGURATION, AND NEITHER IS OPTIONAL. Measured
#: 2026-09-13 by installing the plugin in this machine's Claude Code from a
#: local marketplace: with `mcp.json` and `"mcpServers": "./mcp.json"` in the
#: manifest, `claude plugin details aihawk` reports **MCP servers (0)** - the
#: plugin installs, validates, and delivers no tools at all. So does the
#: inline form. Only a file named `.mcp.json` at the plugin root is read, with
#: or without the manifest field, and it is read even carrying the Agent
#: Plugins `$schema` and `type` keys. Meanwhile the Agent Plugins spec (§7.2.1)
#: says the MCP configuration path is `mcp.json` and MUST NOT be loaded from an
#: alternative path, which is what cursor.directory scans for.
#:
#: Hence both names, byte-identical, held equal here. `claude plugin validate`
#: passed on the broken arrangement: a manifest that validates is not a
#: manifest that works, and only running the thing said so.

    ⛔ AN AUDIT ON 2026-09-13 COUNTED 24 DUPLICATED FACTS AND FOUND 9 WITH
    NOTHING HOLDING THEM TOGETHER: the licence in four files, the author in

    Two differences are DELIBERATE and are asserted as differences, not
    smoothed away, because an unexplained difference is how the next reader
    decides one of them is a bug:

    * `homepage`. The bundle manifest has `homepage`, `documentation` and
      `support` as separate fields, so its homepage is the repository and its
      documentation is the wiki. A plugin manifest has only `homepage`, so it
      points at the wiki page for this server, which is the more useful of the
      two for somebody who just installed a plugin. Same fact, different field
      sets, and each file uses the most specific field it has.
    * the PyPI summary in `pyproject.toml`. It addresses somebody choosing a
      command to install, not somebody browsing a directory of MCP servers,
      and it is tuned for that. It is not a copy of the directory description
      and is not asserted to be one.
