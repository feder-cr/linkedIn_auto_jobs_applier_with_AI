"""The two listings this package publishes to describe the version that ships.

Two files in this repository are read by somebody else's machine, not by ours:

  1. `server.json` at the root is what `mcp-publisher` sends to the Official
     MCP Registry, and the registry checks the PyPI package it names for a
     `mcp-name: <server name>` token in the published description, which is
     README.md. A version in server.json that is not the version on the index
     is refused by the registry; a missing token is refused too, with
     "Registry validation failed for package".
  2. `manifest.json` at the root makes the repository itself the MCP bundle
     (MCPB manifest 0.4, server.type "uv"): `scripts/pack_bundle.py` zips
     the tracked tree minus `.mcpbignore`, and a host runs the server from
     the archive with `uv run --directory <bundle> python -m aihawk`, which
     installs the package from the bundle's own `pyproject.toml`. Until
     2026-09-13 the bundle was a separate `mcpb/` folder whose pyproject
     pinned the published package - a pointer to PyPI, spec-valid but not
     the layout the spec describes, and `type: python` with nothing bundled,
     which the spec forbids. Now the manifest carries a copy of the version
     and the archive carries the source.

That is three copies of one number (pyproject, server.json, the manifest)
and one token that must match a name. Each pair was written by hand on
2026-09-12 and they agreed; nothing made them agree. The registry job in
publish.yml runs on the tag, which is after the bump, and would only find out
at the end of a release. This test finds out on the pull request.

  3. Since 2026-09-13, five manifests at the root are read by plugin loaders
     and directory crawlers: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (Claude Code plugin,
     which points at `mcp.json`), `plugin.json` and `mcp.json` (the Agent
     Plugins standard, which cursor.directory scans for), `.cursor-plugin/
     plugin.json` (Cursor's marketplace) and `gemini-extension.json` (the
     Gemini CLI gallery, which crawls the `gemini-cli-extension` topic). None
     of them carries the package version - a manifest that just says `uvx
     aihawk` does not change per release - but every one of them repeats the
     package name, the one-line description and the launch command, and the
     bundle manifest repeats the description too. Those are the copies this
     file makes agree.

Every check is a function over strings and dicts, and a second test feeds them
known-bad input: a check that has only ever said "consistent" is not a check.

#: 2026-09-13 by installing the plugin in this machine's Claude Code from a
#: local marketplace: with `mcp.json` and `"mcpServers": "./mcp.json"` in the
#: manifest, `claude plugin details aihawk` reports **MCP servers (0)** - the
#: plugin installs, validates, and delivers no tools at all. So does the
#: inline form. Only a file named `.mcp.json` at the plugin root is read, with
#: or without the manifest field, and it is read even carrying the Agent
#: Plugins `$schema` and `type` keys. Meanwhile the Agent Plugins spec (§7.2.1)
#: says the MCP configuration path is `mcp.json` and MUST NOT be loaded from an
#: alternative path, which is what cursor.directory scans for.
#:
#: Hence both names, byte-identical, held equal here. `claude plugin validate`
#: passed on the broken arrangement: a manifest that validates is not a
#: manifest that works, and only running the thing said so.
