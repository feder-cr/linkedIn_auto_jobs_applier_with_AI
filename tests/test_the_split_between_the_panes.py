"""Dragging the divider, and the arithmetic that keeps both panes usable.

⛔ WHICH PANE DESERVES THE ROOM IS A PROPERTY OF THE TASK. Reading a long answer
wants one ratio, watching a form get filled wants another, and a ratio this file
picks is right for neither for long. So the page ships a measured default and
lets it be dragged - which is the change the project's own layout research rated
first, on the grounds that the audience for this tool is closer to an editor
than to a consumer chat.

The part worth executing is the CLAMP. A width dragged wide on a big monitor and
remembered would strand the right pane down to nothing on a laptop, and nothing
about that failure is visible in a string scan: the page still parses, the
handler still exists, and the browser view is simply gone. So the two functions
that compute it are lifted out and run, the same way the renderer is.
