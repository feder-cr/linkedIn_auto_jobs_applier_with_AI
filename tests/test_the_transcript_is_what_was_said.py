"""What goes into a saved conversation is what was SAID, and nothing else.

⛔ THE READING HALF OF THIS RULE HAS EXISTED SINCE 2026-09-08 AND THE WRITING
HALF DID NOT. `OpenRouterBrain.remember` drops the saved system message on the
way in, because restoring it wholesale put an OLD prompt back and every change
to the instructions reached new conversations only - a file winning against the
code with nothing saying so. Nothing stopped `ChatService.save` from writing
one, so every saved conversation went on carrying a copy of this build's
prompt: measured on the developer's own file, 1205 characters that nothing
would ever read.

That is not a defect of behaviour - the restore already ignores it - which is
exactly why it survived. It is a copy of CODE inside a file of DATA, and the
remedy for a stale duplicate is to stop WRITING it rather than to keep
remembering to ignore it.

Both halves are asserted here, on either side of the file: what is written
down, and what a build makes of a file somebody else wrote.
