"""Every third-party module this package imports is one it declares.

⛔ A DIRECT IMPORT OF A TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCY IS A BET ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S
PYPROJECT. `src/aihawk/mcp/server.py` says `from pydantic import Field` and
`pyproject.toml` did not mention pydantic at all: it arrived because `mcp`
requires it. That works until `mcp` stops requiring it, or moves to a major this
code cannot use, and then `aihawk` fails at IMPORT for every user who installs
it - with a traceback that names pydantic and a cause that is nowhere near it.

Nothing could have caught it either. Every environment that has `mcp` has
pydantic, so the suite is green, the CI is green, a clean-environment check is
green, and the wheel is broken only in a future that has not happened yet. The
same is true of `httpx`, which the interface-to-real-server test imports and
which also arrives through `mcp`.

The rule is the one this repository already applies to the engine and to the
core pin, moved one layer out: use what you declare. It is not about pinning
tightly - the floors here are the lowest that are true - it is about the
declaration existing at all, so a resolver can be told and a reader can see it.

⛔ WHAT THIS DOES NOT SEE, because a green says what it checked. It reads
IMPORTS, so a dependency reached by `importlib.import_module` with a computed
name is invisible; and it says nothing about whether a floor is high enough,
which is a question only a resolver can answer. It also leaves the pytest
PLUGINS alone: `pytest-asyncio` is never imported by anything and is declared
correctly, because a plugin is loaded by pytest rather than by the code.
