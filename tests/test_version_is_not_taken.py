"""The version a change proposes must not already be on the index, unless
nothing that ships has moved since it was published.

⛔ MEASURED 2026-09-04, AND NOTHING SAW IT. `aihawk 0.4.0` was published at
23:47. Over the following hours main gained two more changes - verbs for the
session tools, and a `.env` plus a raised dependency floor - while `pyproject`
still said `0.4.0`. So main carried content that was not the content of the
0.4.0 on the index, and no test, gate or workflow had an opinion about it.

The way that goes wrong is quiet, which is why it deserves a gate rather than a
habit. `publish.yml` asks the index first and treats an already-present version
as a deliberate no-op:

    200) present=yes
         "aihawk $VERSION is already on the index. No-op, not a failure."

That is correct for a re-pushed or backfilled tag, and it cannot tell that case
apart from somebody forgetting to bump. So the release would have reported
success and shipped nothing, and the next person to look would find the feature
missing from a version that was tagged, released and green.

PULL REQUESTS ONLY, and that is the whole design. A pull request proposes new
content; if its version is already published, that content can never reach
anybody. On main straight after a release the version IS the published one until
somebody bumps, which is a normal resting state and not a defect, so a check
that ran there would be red for a reason nobody can act on - and a gate that is
red at rest is a gate people learn to skip.

⛔ AND "NEW CONTENT" MEANS WHAT THE INDEX SERVES, which the first version of
this file got wrong on its first day. It refused every pull request whose
version was published, and the first two after a release were the ledger the
publish workflow opens by itself and the changelog entry for that release. A
version bump on either would be a lie: nothing that ships had moved. The
question the gate asks now is the one it always meant. Since the tag of the
published version, has anything changed that goes into the wheel - the package
tree the build backend names, or `pyproject.toml`? The ledger, the changelog,
the tests, the workflows and the docs alter nothing anybody installs, so they
pass without a bump; a change under the package does not.

That needs the tag in the checkout, so the `version` CI job fetches the full
history. A version that is on the index with no tag in the clone is refused
outright rather than guessed at. The outcomes are free, taken-but-unmoved,
taken-and-moved, and cannot-tell, and only the third is a defect while the
fourth is a broken bench.

Enabled by AIHAWK_CHECK_VERSION, which the `version` CI job sets itself, so it
cannot silently skip the way it does in a local run.
