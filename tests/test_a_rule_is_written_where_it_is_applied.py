"""A rule about how a file reaches the disk is written once, where it happens.

⛔ `store.save` CARRIED THE BYTES-NOT-TEXT RULE IN FULL AND DOES NOT APPLY IT.
It calls `storage.write_atomically`, which is where the rule lives and where it
is documented. So the copy in `save` was a rule written where it is not
applied: a reader fixing it there would have changed nothing, and the two were
free to drift into two accounts of one decision.

Two things make this worth a gate rather than a quiet edit. `store.load`, five
lines below, already did it right - it names `storage.read_json` and says the
reason is not repeated here. And `storage.py` opens by arguing that the atomic
write was once copied into both files "with only one of the two carrying the
comment explaining why", and that two copies is the arrangement where a fix
reaches one of them. The module that removed the duplicated CODE kept a
duplicate of its own headline rule in prose.

Found by a scan for prose repeated across modules, which is the detector worth
keeping: eight-word runs of comment or docstring text appearing in more than
one file.
