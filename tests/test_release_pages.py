"""Every version on the index needs a GitHub release carrying it.

Measured 2026-09-02, on this repository: FIVE published versions, five tags, and
ZERO releases. The rule has existed for months and the two sibling packages each
have a test enforcing it. This one did not, so nothing here ever said so, and the
gap grew one release at a time without anything downstream breaking.

That is the whole reason this file exists. The releases were backfilled by hand
the same day, and a gap fixed by hand and guarded by nothing reopens on the next
release.

The release page is where a reader looks for what changed. Without it `git
describe` has nothing to say and there is no commit anybody can point at as the
source of the version they have.

WALKS EVERY VERSION, not the latest. The sibling test read `info.version` until
2026-08-02, so the moment a release shipped without its page the NEXT release
hid the omission: the check moved on and the old gap stayed behind it. Eleven
published versions across three packages turned out to have no release, three of
them published after the backfill that test was written to protect.

ONE-DIRECTIONAL on purpose, for RELEASE PAGES. A release page for a version not
yet on the index is a normal intermediate state during a publish. An index
version with no release page is the thing that gets forgotten, precisely because
nothing breaks.

⛔ AND THE OTHER DIRECTION HAS A HOLE THAT COST A RELEASE ON 2026-09-14, WHICH
THE SECOND WALK BELOW CLOSES. `v0.56.0` was tagged, the publish workflow ran,
its `gate` job died on a 504 downloading the engine from GitHub Releases, and
`upload` was therefore SKIPPED. So the tag existed, main carried the bumped
version, and the index served nothing - a state indistinguishable from a
successful release unless somebody opens the run and reads it. Nothing in this
suite could see it: this file walks the INDEX, so a version that never reached
the index is not in anything it looks at, and `test_version_is_not_taken`
answers "free" for exactly that case, which is its correct answer.

A TAG is the durable artifact of an attempted release - the release page is not,
because a failed gate skips that too - so the second walk starts from tags, and
it is bounded by AGE rather than being forbidden outright: a tag pushed a minute
ago and not yet on the index is a publish in flight, which is normal, and one
from an hour ago is a release that silently shipped nothing.

Enabled by AIHAWK_CHECK_RELEASES, which the `releases` CI job sets. It is one API
call per version against a network service, so it does not belong in the unit
suite, and a job that sets the variable itself cannot silently skip.
