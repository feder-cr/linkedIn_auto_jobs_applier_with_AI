"""Several conversations, each with its own transcript and its own browsers.

⛔ WHAT MAKES THIS REAL RATHER THAN DECORATION is that a conversation drives its
OWN browsers, and how that is true changed completely on 2026-09-11. It used to
be one shared connection with the session id imposed on every call - pinned in
`test_a_session_reaches_only_its_own_browsers.py`, which is gone with the class
it tested, `SessionLink`. MCP has no session concept to impose an id onto any
more: no tool takes one. So the thing that keeps two conversations apart is no
longer a value on a shared wire, it is which CONNECTION exists at all - each
conversation spawns its own, told at birth which saved file is its own. This
file is about the layer where conversations are made, listed, saved, reopened
and deleted; that separation is now proven here, by giving each conversation
its own recording double instead of one shared one.

No browser, no model and no server: `Sessions` is built with an `open_link`
seam that hands back one `FakeLink` per conversation id instead of spawning a
real process, so what a conversation did is observable as the calls its OWN
double recorded - and, critically, NOT recorded on any other conversation's.
The brain answers without thinking, and `AIHAWK_HOME` points at a temporary
directory for every test (see `tests/conftest.py`), so what a conversation
wrote is observable as the files it left behind.

    reached the composer's handler, a click on the conversation behind it did
    nothing, and choosing a conversation carried the panel across the navigation
    so the page you had just asked for arrived already covered.

    That is what made covering unacceptable rather than merely bold. A panel
    that lies over the page and puts it out of play has to be one gesture away
    from gone, and there are three gestures: the key, the click outside, and
    picking the thing you opened it for.

    Executed, because none of it can be read off the text: the handlers are
    registered in capture on `document`, and what matters is the ORDER they run
    in and which events they swallow. Escape while the panel is CLOSED must not
    be swallowed - that key belongs to the composer, where it stops a run.

    The spine case is the subtle one. `pointerdown` and `click` both fire on a
    real press, so without the second guard the panel closes on the press and
    the button's own handler reopens it on the click: the one control that opens
    it could never close it.
