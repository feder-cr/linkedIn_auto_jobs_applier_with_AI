"""Start an unpacked bundle the way its manifest says, and speak MCP to it.

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS: THE CI RAN `--help` AND CALLED IT PROOF. The `bundle` job
packed the archive, unpacked it and ran
`uv run --directory <unpacked> python -m aihawk --help`, which prints click's
help text. A bundle whose server could not start, could not complete
`initialize`, or answered `tools/list` with nothing would have been green all
the way to a directory review, because `--help` never reaches any of that.

What this does instead, in the order a host does it:

1. reads `manifest.json` from the unpacked bundle, so the command under test
   is the one the manifest DECLARES rather than one written here a second
   time. `${__dirname}` is substituted the way the MCPB spec says a host
   substitutes it, with the bundle's own directory.
2. spawns that command as a subprocess over stdio.
3. completes the MCP handshake and reads `serverInfo`.
4. lists the tools and checks the set is the one the package registers.

Exit 0 on success, 1 with the reason on failure. It prints what it found, so
a CI log says which build and how many tools rather than nothing.

Run it with the bundle's own interpreter, so the `mcp` client library resolves
from the bundle's dependencies:

    uv run --directory /tmp/unpacked python scripts/bundle_speaks_mcp.py /tmp/unpacked
