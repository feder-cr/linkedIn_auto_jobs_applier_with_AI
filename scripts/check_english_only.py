"""This repository is public and English-only. This gate says so mechanically.

Why it exists, and it is not a style preference. On 2026-08-27 a whole new
subsystem - the `_juggler` client, its three generator scripts and its four
test files, about four thousand lines - was written in ITALIAN and committed
here: module names, class names, public method names, every comment. Nothing
caught it. The repo had been English since its first commit, `pytest` was green
throughout, and the pre-push hook had no opinion about the language a file is
written in.

A convention that lives only in the heads of the people writing the code is not
a convention, it is a habit, and a habit skips a session. It is the same lesson
this project already wrote down for gates: an invariant nobody can check is an
invariant that drifts.

    python scripts/check_english_only.py                # 1 if Italian is found
    python scripts/check_english_only.py --range A..B   # only what a push adds
    python scripts/check_english_only.py --selftest     # 9 mutations, 9 that must not fire

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, said out loud because a gate whose limits are unstated
gets trusted too far. It does not detect Spanish, French or Portuguese. It does
not judge prose quality. It cannot see a single Italian noun with no Italian
function word near it: `def calcola(x)` on its own passes. What it catches is
Italian PROSE, which is what comments and docstrings are made of, and prose is
what actually happened.
